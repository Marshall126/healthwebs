          <h3>What are Antibiotics and Superbugs?</h3>
          <p>
            Antibiotics are pills that are used to fight bacteria, but are <strong>NOT</strong> effective against viral infections, such as the flu. While antibiotics can cure illnesses and save lives, they can cause allergic reactions, impact body balance, and create superbugs.</strong>
            Superbugs are bacteria that have become resistant to one or more antibiotics, due to the antibiotics being overused.
            This occurs due to antibiotics only killing most of the harmful bacteria in the body, and not all of it. The surviving bacteria would then reproduce, which would create more bacteria with those same antibiotic resistant genes.
            There are already a sizeable amount of superbugs that exist, a notable one being the bacteria that causes gonorrhea. "98% of gonorrheal bacteria in Southeast Asia are resistant to penicillin" (7).
